title: Sage has an AI Lab. So what?
---

The Internet is currently cluttered with posts on how AI is going to change the world and software as we know it, and I
am sure your marketing team can’t wait for you to release an AI backed feature so they can update their landing page
with “AI powered technology”. So, when I sat down and began writing this piece introducing Sage AI Labs (SAIL) I asked
myself the question, “Why would anyone care?”

## An exciting mission
SAIL is a cross functional team delivering ML projects across [Sage.](https://www.sage.com) We bring together experts distributed across six
countries with various skill sets, and [embrace continuous delivery for machine learning](https://martinfowler.com/articles/cd4ml.html).
Our assignment is to transform Sage into an AI-enabled technology business.

Before you roll your eyes at a corporate mission statement let me set some context. At Sage we have an impressive
portfolio of Accounting, Financial and HR software backed with data sets in domains that are ideal for [AI disruption.](https://diginomica.com/ai-expands-potential-risks-finance)
Whether it’s eliminating the month end close, automatically capturing financial documents, or providing bold financial
insights, any ML practitioner worth their weight can see SAIL has a critical role to play in delivering customer value
at Sage.

## Production or it didn’t happen

So how is SAIL enabling this AI transformation? Within our team we have an internal mantra of “Production or it didn’t
happen”. By this we mean that until the software we build makes it into the hands of customers, the work doesn’t have
any use or meaning. We chant this each morning because our team believes that the best way to empower Sage comes through
delivery. We gravitate to this mindset because we know that you can do all the planning in the world, but it’s not until
your model is in front of a customer that you can truly evaluate whether your hard work has any value.

There are many benefits that come with this delivery focused mindset. For example, it means that our Data Scientists
look to deliver their first baseline model without fanfare so that risky integration issues are tackled early. It
encourages our Engineers to leverage automation as much as possible and ultimately defines a team that is driven to
think outside the box when faced with the challenges of delivering enterprise software.

## Team > sum(parts)
This leads to another point about why you should care about SAIL. We believe the team is greater than the sum of its
parts. It’s alarming to read online about the struggle's companies face when delivering ML solutions. To help combat
this risk we designed SAIL as a full stack machine learning department.

This means that we bring together a range of technical skills such as Product Managers looking for customer value,
Data Scientists running experiments, ML Engineers delivering pipelines and a Cloud Infrastructure team supporting the
SAIL platform. Enterprises often underestimate what it takes to deliver machine learning at scale and creating a highly
cross functional team has been critical to our success.

Hopefully, this post has given you a glimpse of the Machine Learning culture we have built at SAIL, resonates with
technologists, and has incited your curiosity. The reality is that ML is a rapidly evolving space both in general and
at Sage. The team continues to work hard delivering on projects and I'm looking forward to sharing our journey with you.
