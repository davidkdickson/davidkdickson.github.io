title: A basic python debugger
---

As a learning exercise I set myself the goal of building a basic debugger in Python. My hope was to deliver on the
following functionality:

* Step in, over and out
* Break at line number
* Continue execution

This post will focus on getting the basic stepping through code functionality working. If you want to skip ahead and see
the finished project checkout this [repository.](https://github.com/davidkdickson/pydbg)

## Setting a trace function
As I began to develop my solution I was pleased to identify `sys.settrace(trace_function)` a function that sets the systemâ€™s
trace function. The `trace_function` callback you set will be triggered by the python virtual machine every time it enters
or exits a function, processes a line of code or runs into an exception. Each of these callbacks also give full access
to the current stack frame and code. Thus one way to implement stepping through source code would be to set this
callback to a custom implementation.

Below shows an example [implementation](https://github.com/davidkdickson/pydbg/blob/master/examples/blog_example.py) that
sets such a callback and steps through a recursive factorial implementation.

{% highlight python %}
import sys
import inspect

class Pydbg:
    def print_source(self, frame, event, arg):
        (file, line, func, code, idx) = \
                inspect.getframeinfo(frame)
        line = f'{file}:{line}:{func}\n--> {code[idx]}'
        print(line)

    def get_command(self):
        return 's'

    def trace_calls(self, frame, event, arg):
        self.print_source(frame, event, arg)
        self.cmd = self.get_command()

        if self.cmd == 's':
            return self.trace_calls

        self.print_source(frame, event, arg)

        raise 'Unknown command'

    def break_point(self):
        sys.settrace(self.trace_calls)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    pydbg = Pydbg()

    def factorial(n):
        if n == 0:
            return 1
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

    pydbg.break_point()
    print(factorial(3))
{% endhighlight %}

And when run gives the following output.


{% highlight zsh %}
$ python blog_example.py
blog_example.py:34:factorial
-->     def factorial(n):

blog_example.py:35:factorial
-->         if n == 0:

blog_example.py:37:factorial
-->         return n * factorial(n - 1)

blog_example.py:34:factorial
-->     def factorial(n):

blog_example.py:35:factorial
-->         if n == 0:

blog_example.py:37:factorial
-->         return n * factorial(n - 1)
{% endhighlight %}


In this example once the breakpoint is set all subsequent calls will invoke the trace function which in turn calls
`print_source` to output the current line of source code being executed. Notice that `trace_calls` returns a reference
to itself as it steps through the code. This is because `settrace` causes the callback to be invoked whenever a new local
scope is entered and expects the returning of a reference to the function that should be used for further tracing in that new
scope. In the example above it was sufficient to return the same tracing function.

## Conclusion
`settrace` allows for incredible introspection from within a program and really makes it very simple to build a basic
debugger. It was fun exploring how this function worked and helped improve my understanding of the Python runtime.
When I compare what it took me to build similar functionality in [C++](https://github.com/davidkdickson/basicdbg) it was
strikingly different in terms of complexity and effort.
