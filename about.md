I am a Software Engineer that used to dance. Professionally this seems like a contradiction, however it has kept life interesting. Currently I work for [Compass](http://www.compass.co) where we build products to help increase the success rate of ecommerce companies. Programming is an awesome job because you get to solve problems. The more complex the problem the more fun I seem to have.
