I am a programmer that used to dance. Professionaly this seems like a contradiction, however it has kept life interesting. Currently I work for [Compass](http://www.compass.co) where we build products to help increase the success rate of startups. Programming is an awesome job because you get to solve problems. The more complex the problem the more fun I seem to have.
