I am a programmer that used to dance. Professionaly this seems like a contradiction, however it has kept life interesting. Currently I work for [Readify](http://www.readify.net) where I help clients build software. Programming is an enjoyable job because we get to solve problems. The more complex the problem the more fun I seem to have.
